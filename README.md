# MarkYourPresence By Sukhmani Kaur
This year the Microsoft Engage Mentees were given with 3 challenges to choose from and build a functional prototypr under the guidance of mentors.
The 3 challenges were-
1-Face Recognition
2-Data Analysis
3-Algorithms

The challenge chosen by me is **Face Recognition**.
